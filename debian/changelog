  * debian/rules: stop handling DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS=noopt on our own, nowadays
    dpkg takes care of that.
  * debian/watch: rewrite to point at launchpad.net and improve it.
  * use dh_bash-completion to handle the bash completion. (This also fixes the
    package-installs-into-obsolete-dir lintian warning when using

    + debian/inkscape.maintscript: also remove the bash completion from /etc.
  * debian/upstream/signing-key.asc: add, with the key of the 3 inkscape
    release managers. We can't currently automate the signature check in
    debian/watch because they seems to do not use a costant suffix for the
    signature (sometimes .asc, sometimes .sig).
    Add the key anyway, so the tarball can easily be verified manually or by
    other means.
  * debian/inkscape.lintian-overrides: add to override a couple of
    spelling-error-in-manpage due to French words.
